# unwee

A simple tool written in `go` to unshorten short urls.
Takes bunch of URLs and returns the unshortened URLs

## TODO:

- [ ] Code Cleanup ðŸ˜“ 
- [x] Proper flags for URL inputs (currently only takes input from STDIN)
- [x] Flag for output files to store the results
- [x] Support for output format(in JSON, currently supports TXT)
- [ ] `-ex` (exclude) flag to not include unreachable/invalid URLs in the output file

more freatures if possible?
